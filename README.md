# Flight_Manager User Manual

1. Procedure: Welcome->Function->Table->Operation
2. Add: Regarding the input of added functions, I originally wanted to make it all horizontally arranged, that is, 4 boxes in a row, two column names and two input boxes, but after the program finally ran successful, I was afraid that I would make the wrong changes again, and I made many changes. I found that I don't know how to achieve this effect, so I can only run it as it is now.
3. Delete: I want to do a restore but I don't know why it didn't work out.
4. Query: I originally wanted to get all the column names and put them into a drop-down box. When the user selects a column name in the drop-down box, an input box will appear. After clicking the input box to enter the content, a second drop-down box will appear for help. The user accurately locates the content that requires the query, but I don't want the second drop-down box to appear, so I made it like this. After making it like this, I originally wanted to add a check box. After clicking the check box, I can implement precise query, but because I started writing the program relatively late, I didn't have enough time, so I didn't do it.
5. Alter: You need to double clicked the row you want to alter.
6. Statistics: Everytime I clicked Query the overall layout will change. I think it's because I used pack and grid in the two functions, but I don't know how to change it because I want to keep the original layout.
7. I hate replt auto-beautify!!! Every time I press 'Ctrl+S', IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE ' = ' TO '='! I am really not used to it... And it will take some of my efforts modifying.
8. Hedi is my English name.
